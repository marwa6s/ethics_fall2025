In this podcast, me and my podcast partners came up with fictional scenarios of ways technology is harmful to human beings. My personal episode titled "Faith in the age of Deepfake" talks about fake AI videos of muslim scholars on tiktok spreading disinformation about the islamic religion. other examples my partners came up with was harms for self driving cars, harms of meta glasses. We also fliped the script on one of our scenarios and viewed it in a positive way ("Light mirror"). Enjoy listening!
